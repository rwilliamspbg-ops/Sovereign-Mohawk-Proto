### 🔍 Audit Target
Specify which theorem or code section you audited (e.g., Theorem 5 Verification Logic, zk-SNARK Aggregation).

### 🛠️ Methodology
Describe how you verified the logic (e.g., manual code review, formal solver, or running the `proofs/` scripts).

### 📋 Findings
- **Status:** [PASSED / FAILED / OBSERVATION]
- **Details:** Provide a technical breakdown of your findings.
- **Accuracy Verification:** Did it match the reported 10ms verification time or the Round 45 Audit results?

### 💡 Suggestions
Any improvements to the cryptographic primitives or potential edge cases discovered?
